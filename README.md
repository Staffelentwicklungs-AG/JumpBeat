# JumpBeat<br/>
This game prototype was developed as part of a weekly student project within a game development training program. Each student group explores a different core mechanic inspired by modern AAA games but scaled down to fit a beginner-friendly scope using the Unity Engine (2D or 3D).<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to help students learn essential development workflows such as:<br/>
  -Scripting<br/>
  -Scene building<br/>
  -Asset integration<br/>
  -UI and UX basics<br/>
  -Simple game logic<br/>
<br/>
Each prototype features a unique gameplay twist (USP) and focuses on one specific mechanic or idea.<br/>
Inspired by: Hi-Fi Rush / Beat Saber<br/>
Genre: 2D Rhythm Platformer<br/>
USP: Player jumps and dodges obstacles in sync with the beat. Everything moves to the rhythm.<br/>
Main focus: Music synchronization, obstacle timing, rhythm logic.<br/>
